## Introduction: Basic Program
Java is a popular programming language that is used to develop a wide variety of applications, from mobile apps to enterprise systems. Like Python and C, it is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it organizes code into classes that contain properties (variables) and methods (functions).

Here is a simple Java program that prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
- public class HelloWorld declares a new class called HelloWorld.
- public static void main(String[] args) is the entry point for the program. This method is called when the program is run, and it takes an array of strings called args as an argument.
- System.out.println("Hello, World!"); prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console.

To run this code, save it to a file called HelloWorld.java, and then compile and run it using the following commands in the terminal:
```cmd
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```
