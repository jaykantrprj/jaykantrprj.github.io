> how to use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications
## Introduction
Docker Compose is used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The file specifies how multiple Docker containers should be run and managed. This file is named as "docker-compose.yml" file, which includes information about volumes, services, network required for the application.

This article will cover the basics of Docker Compose, including its structure, components and provide some general examples.

## Docker Compose Basics:
Let's understand the basic terminologies used in Docker Compose:
- Service: Individual container that performs a specific task within the application.
- Volume: A volume is a shared directory between the host system and a container.
- Network: A network is a communication channel that allows different services to communicate with each other.

## Structure of Docker Compose
A Docker Compose file is written in YAML format and is used to define the services, volumes, and networks for a multi-container application. The file consists of the following sections:
- Version: Version of Docker Compose used to create the file.
- Services: Defines the containers required for the application.
- Networks: Defines the communication channels between the services.
- Volumes: Defines the shared directories between the host system and the containers.

Each component in the Docker Compose file has its own syntax, as shown in the following examples.

### Example 1: Defining a Simple Web Application

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root_password
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - db
```
This Docker Compose file defines two services: db and web. The db service uses the mysql:5.7 image and sets the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable. The web service uses the nginx:latest image and maps the port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container. It also specifies that it depends on the db service.
